# STAG: Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

STAG is a C++ library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs. The development of STAG is part of He Sun's Fellowship  titled "Efficient Spectral Algorithms for Massive and Dynamic Graphs", which is funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, EP/T00729X/1). The team for developing STAG consists of [Peter Macgregor](https://pmacg.github.io/index.html) and [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).

## Project Status
The project is under active development and more information and documentation will be added here, and [our website](http://staglibrary.io) in the near future.
