# STAG: Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

[![Build](https://github.com/pmacg/stag/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pmacg/stag/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml)

STAG is a C++ library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs.

## Project Status
The project is under active development and more information and documentation will be added here in the near future.

## Funding Information
The development of this library is part of He Sun's Fellowship  titled "Efficient Spectral Algorithms for Massive and Dynamic Graphs", which is funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, EP/T00729X/1). The team for developing this library consists of [Peter Macgregor](https://pmacg.github.io/index.html) and [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).
